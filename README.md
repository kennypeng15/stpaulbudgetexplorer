# St. Paul Budget Explorer

## Background and Motivation
The St. Paul Budget explorer is an application created by David Ma and Kenny Peng (me)
for our CSCI 5609 course at the UMN-TC, spring 2022.

The application is written in the Processing programming language.

The application was our final project submission for the course, and was designed to showcase
the different methods of conveying information we learned throughout the course.

Our submission earned the "User Achievement Award" as one of the top 3 submissions in the class.
